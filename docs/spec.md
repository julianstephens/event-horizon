﻿Title: Real-time Event Tracking System

Overview:
You are tasked with building a real-time event tracking system that can handle high volumes of data and provide detailed analytics for various events happening across multiple platforms. The platform should be scalable to accommodate future growth in the number of users, events, or data volume.

Deliverables:
1. A RESTful API built with Python (Flask) or Golang (Echo) that can receive event data from different sources and store it into a database for real-time analytics.
2. A web dashboard where administrators can view aggregated data, create custom reports, and set up alerts based on specific conditions. The frontend should be built with React or VueJS.
3. A mobile application (Android & iOS) that allows users to track events in real-time and receive push notifications for important updates. Use Flutter for the cross-platform app development.
4. Documentation of the API endpoints, database schema, and any other relevant technical details.
5. Unit tests covering all critical functionality of the application.
6. A deployment guide to help deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS or GCP.
7. A detailed analysis report highlighting performance metrics such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, etc., and suggesting optimizations if needed.

Expected Functionality:
1. The backend API should support multiple data sources (e.g., webhooks, HTTP POST requests) to receive event data in various formats like JSON or CSV. It must validate the incoming data against a predefined schema before storing it into the database.
2. Implement an efficient indexing system that allows for fast retrieval of event data based on different criteria such as date range, user IDs, etc.
3. The web dashboard should display real-time analytics for various events and allow administrators to create custom reports using filters like time period, event type, user groups, etc. These reports can be exported in CSV or PDF format.
4. For the mobile application, users should be able to track their favorite events in real-time and receive push notifications when specific conditions are met (e.g., an event exceeds a certain threshold). The app should also allow basic user management features like login/logout, account settings, etc.
5. Implement necessary security measures such as HTTPS, input validation, access control, and proper error handling to ensure the system is secure and robust.
6. Use a scalable database solution like PostgreSQL or MongoDB that can handle large volumes of data and provide efficient querying capabilities.
7. Utilize message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing tasks such as sending push notifications, generating reports, etc.
8. Use a caching system like Redis to improve the performance of frequently accessed data or API endpoints.
9. Implement logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application performance and identify potential issues.
10. Write unit tests for all critical components of the application using testing frameworks such as pytest or ginkgo.

Suggestions:
- Use AWS Lambda with API Gateway for serverless backend deployment.
- Implement authentication using JWT tokens and securely store them in a key management service like AWS KMS.
- For data visualization on the web dashboard, consider using libraries such as D3.js or Chart.js.
- Use Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) for push notifications on Android devices and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS devices.
